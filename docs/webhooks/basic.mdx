Basic webhook allows you integrate, with any 

## Verification

Supports basic Auth token

## Parser

The basic parser will haveily depend on the source of the request,
We have added a simple example of adding the body as new row, but you can modify it to your needs 


```typescript
const basicParser: Parser = async({req, db,ref}) => {
      // request is the request object from the webhook
      // db is the database object
      // ref is the reference to collection of the table
      // the returned object will be added as a new row to the table
      // eg: adding the webhook body as row
      const {body } = req;
      return body;
  }

```
