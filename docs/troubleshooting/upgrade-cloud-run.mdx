## Error: With Cloud Run Deployments (derivatives, cloud functions, and extensions)?

If your Cloud Run deployments are failing using Rowy Run services, which may cause failure to the new deployments to derivatives, extensions, due to legacy nodejs version. As support to **Node v18.0 has reached its EOL on April 30**, 2025 Please refer to the steps to update the ```rowy-backend service``` to fix the issues with deployments.

As a fix we have updated our backend to use **Node v22**. 

## Prerequisites:
- Enable Firebase Extension Google API 
- Enable Cloud Billing API
- Ensure the rowy-backend service account is having a firebase extension developer role. ```(rowy-backend@<your-project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com)```
- To add you can go to IAM and Admin > IAM > Select the service account > Edit > Add another role > Search for Firebase Extension Developer > Save

In GCP console (https://console.cloud.google.com/run), go to the **Cloud Run** section and select the **rowy-backend** service.

Then click on the **Edit and Deploy New Revision** button.

**Note:** Keep the configuration as default, and do not change any other settings, unless required. Click Deploy.

**Note:** If you encounter due to memory limit, you may need to increase the memory limit to 1GB or 4GB.

Once the deployment is complete, you will see a new revision created and cloud functions should deploy as nodejs v22.

## Note
- This is a one-time process and you will not need to repeat this step for every deployment.
- you'll need to redeploy any of existing rowy functions (derivatives, cloud functions, and extensions), as Firebase is no longer running and supporting the v18 functions.
- No change in the processes of deploying the derivatives, cloud functions, and extensions.
