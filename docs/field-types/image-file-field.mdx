import imageField from "./assets/image-field.png";
import populatedField from "./assets/populated-field.png";
import firestorePath from "./assets/firestore-path.png";
import firestoreJSON from "./assets/firestore-json.png";
import imageURL from "./assets/image-url.png";
import sampleURL from "./assets/sample-url.png";

The Image or File fields enable users to upload images or files. These photos or documents are subsequently 
uploaded to the Firestore, and the returned URL populates the table's columns.

## Steps

1. Click the **Add column** button on the right edge of the table header.

<img 
   src = {imageField}
   alt = "Adding an image column"
/>

2. Set the user-facing **Column name**.
3. Set the **Field key**, which is the name of the field in your Firestore
   document.
4. Set the **Field type** to either **Image** or **File** depending upon the requirement.
5. Upload the image or the file using the **Upload Icon** or simply drag and drop it into the desired cell.

<img 
   src = {populatedField}
   alt = "Adding an image column"
/>

## Working

Once the image or the file is uploaded, it is synced to the connected Firestore database.
A URL is then generated which gets returned to the user, and gets populated in the Rowy table.

By navigating to the side menu, the user can check out all the details of the current row, including
the **Reference Path**, which is the Firestore path where the upload is stored.

<img 
   src = {firestorePath}
   alt = "Firestore path"
/>

Using this link, the user can access the **Firebase Firestore datapoint** for a specific file. 
This is useful for utilizing the **Firebase Storage API**.

<img 
   src = {firestoreJSON}
   alt = "Firestore JSON"
/>

## Using Image Field with URL

Using the Image Field with an existing URL instead of uploading an image is possible with the help of the
**Derivative Column**. The Derivative Columns display values derived from another column's values.

<p align="center">
   <img 
   src = {sampleURL}
   alt = "Sample URL Column"
   width="70%"
   />
</p>

To use this approach, it is required that the project has **Rowy Run enabled**.

### Steps

1. Click the **Add column** button on the right edge of the table header.
2. Set the user-facing **Column name**.
3. Set the **Field key**, which is the name of the field in your Firestore
   document.
4. Set the **Field type** to **Derivative** and set up **Rowy Run** as prompted (if not already).
5. Set the **Column Config** as follows:

   <img
   src = {imageURL}
   alt = "Using Derivative Column to utilize image URL"
   />

   - Set the **Listener fields** to be the column containing the URL of the images.

   - Change the **Output field** type to Image.
   
   - Set the **Derivative script** to:

   ```javascript
   const derivative: Derivative = async ({ row, ref, db, storage, auth }) => {
   return [{ downloadURL: row.URL_FIELD_KEY }]
   }
   ```

   - Change the `URL_FIELD_KEY` to the field key of the URL column.

   - **Lock** the Derivative column to prevent people uploading to this column directly.

   - Continue to add images by providing the URL in the URL column.

## Notes

- The image or the file field might appear very minute. To increase the visiblity if the images, one can simply
increase the row height by navigating to the **Row Height** option on the top right corner.
