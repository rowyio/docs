Use derivatives field type to build your product automations on data CRUD. Use any NPM or APIs to code in JS. Derivative fields derive their value from other fields in the row. They are
automatically evaluated whenever the dependent fields are updated.

In Column Settings, write a function body that returns the value to be displayed
in the field. This code is run in a Node.js cloud function.

To use Derivative fields, you must:

- be comfortable writing simple JavaScript code and
- have Rowy Cloud Functions set up via the
  [one click deploy](https://rowy.app/deploy) of Rowy Run.

## API

Your code has access to the following parameters and can use the
[`await` keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await).

You can also use npm packages using
[CommonJS `require` imports](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/what-is-require/).

| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `row`     | [`Record<string, any>`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#recordkeystype)     | All data in the current row.                                                      |
| `ref`     | [`DocumentReference`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/node/firebase.firestore.DocumentReference) | Reference to the corresponding Firestore document of the current row.             |
| `db`      | [`Firestore`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/node/firebase.firestore.Firestore)                 | Access to the full Cloud Firestore instance to access any collection or document. |
| `auth`    | [`Auth`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/node/admin.auth.Auth-1)                           | Access to Firebase Auth via Admin SDK                                             |
| `storage` | [`Storage`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/admin/node/admin.storage.Storage-1)                  | Access to Firebase Storage via Admin SDK                                          |

## Basic example

Add an additional field to simplify client-side queries.

Problem: On the client-side we want to see which requests are ready for
approval. We need to know which rows have the `amount` and `claim` fieldset. We
don’t want to create a
[composite index](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/index-overview#composite_indexes),
which would be costly.

Solution: Create a new field that contains a boolean value based on the values
of those fields. The client-side can filter by this new field.

```js
const derivative:Derivative = async ({row})=>{
// Mark document as ready for approval
if (row.amount && row.claim) return true;
else return false;
}
```

## Intermediate example

Use data from other parts of the database in this row.

Problem: We want to attach the user’s email to a request. We want to automate
this and not have to expose all the user’s sensitive data on the client-side.

Solution: Create a new field that gets the email. It will run on a secure backend
environment and does not expose sensitive data.

```js
const derivative:Derivative = async ({row,db})=>{
// Get user doc
const userDoc = db.collection("users").doc(row.uid);
return userDoc.get("email");
}
```

## Advanced examples

Use 3rd-party npm packages for more advanced functionality.

### REST API request

To connect with any REST API using fetch 

Problem: We want to get a list of all airport codes from natural language text.

Solution: Use [OpenAI’s GPT-3 API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) to
extract the airport codes as an array.

```js

const derivative:Derivative = async ({row})=>{
const openaiSecret = await rowy.secrets.get("openai")
const prompt = `Airport code extractor:

Text: \"I want to fly form Los Angeles to Miami.\"
Airport codes: LAX, MIA

Text: \"${row.text}\"
Airport codes:`;

const response = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci/completions",{
  headers:{
      Authorization: `Bearer ${openaiSecret}`,
      contentType:"application/json"
  },
  body:JSON.stringify({
  prompt,
  max_tokens: 60,
  temperature: 0.3,
  frequency_penalty: 0,
  top_p: 1,
  stop: ["\n"],
})
})
return response.choices[0].text.split(",'").map((x) => x.trim());
}
```

### Google Cloud API

To use any Google Cloud API, first enable it in the Google Cloud Console.
[Enable Cloud Translation API ↗](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=translate.googleapis.com)  
We automatically set the API credentials as the project’s
[default service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts#default).

Problem: We want to translate some text into another language.

Solution: Use the
[Google Cloud Translation API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=translate.googleapis.com).

```js
const derivative:Derivative = async ({row})=>{
const { Translate } = require("@google-cloud/translate").v2;
// Instantiates a client
const translate = new Translate();
// Translates text field into Spanish
const [translation] = await translate.translate(row.text, "es");
return translation;
}
```

### Cloud Storage

Problem: Users provide images using external URLs, but the images could get
removed from the host provider, leading to broken images.

Solution: using rowy storage utility, store a copy of the image in Firebase Storage.


```js

const derivative:Derivative = async ({row,ref})=>{
  const url = row.externalImage;
  const file = await rowy.storage.upload.url(url,{
    folderPath: ref.path // Optional: stores the file in the storage same folder structure as the document on firestore
  })
  // Return an array of image objects that will be displayed by the Rowy UI
  return [file];
```
