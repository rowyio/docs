## Accessing data from another collection

The following is a code snippet that shows how to access data from another collection and display it as a list of options using the connector field.

```js
const firestoreCollectionConnector: Connector = async ({ db, query, row, user }) => {
  // 1️⃣ Edit Collection: connect to Firestore collection
  const collectionId = "lwjShow"
  // 2️⃣ set max results you want to show in the dropdown
  const maxResults = 5
  // 3️⃣ Edit field: connect to Firestore field to filter by in the input text
  const queryField = "noun" 
  // Map result: use as it is or shape the returned data as need
  const resultsFormatter = (doc) => ({ id: doc.id, snapshot: doc.data() }) 

  // Logic for data retrieval, no edits needed here
  const collectionRef = db.collection(collectionId).limit(maxResults) 
  if (query === "") { 
    return (await collectionRef.get()).docs.map(resultsFormatter)
  } 
  const end = query.replace(/.$/, (c) => String.fromCharCode(c.charCodeAt(0) + 1));
  return (await collectionRef.where(queryField, ">=", query).where(queryField, "<", end).get())
    .docs.map(resultsFormatter)
};
```
