## <span className="changelog-version">v3.0.0</span><span className="changelog-version-separator"> â€“ </span><span>Rowy's biggest release yet ðŸŽ‰ + Introducing BuildShip</span>

<span className="changelog-date"><a href="https://github.com/rowyio/rowy/releases/tag/v3.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><time datetime="2023-10-27T15:21:32Z">27 Oct 2023</time></a></span>

We are super excited to release today, Rowy's next big version. This release has over 100+ amazing new features, enhancements and fixes that our team and a large group of open-source contributors have been working over the last one year in develop branch...

With this release Rowy's open-source project and [Rowy.app](http://rowy.com/) cloud version - our goal is to bring to you the most powerful, yet intuitive way to manage your database on a collaborative spreadsheet / CMS UI. Especially for Firestore and Google Cloud/Firebase stack.

Before diving into the release notes, we invite you to celebrate with us as Rowy's open-source project crosses the milestone of **5,000 stars!** ðŸŒŸðŸ¥³  We will give your project built with Rowy a shoutout in our social channels if you tweet at us [@rowyio](https://twitter.com/rowyio) and say what you built.

**We at the Rowy team also launched a new product called [BuildShip](https://buildship.com) ðŸŽ‰**  
BuildShip is a low-code visual API, scheduled jobs, backend cloud functions builder - in workflow style right from the browser and ship them instantly with a single click (no long build waiting time, that Rowy users complain!).

BuildShip pairs really well with Rowy and is stack-agnostic! So it works with any database like Firestore, Supabase, Postgres and you can build cloud functions for them on data changes and CRUD operations in no-code style. We've prebuilt integrations with AI models from OpenAI, Replicate, and hundreds of third-party tools.

Best part? If any integration is missing, creating a node connector with AI is a breeze. Give [BuildShip](https://buildship.com/) a try from here or join our low-code [Discord](https://buildship.com/discord) to learn more about BuildShip and Rowy.
